# Machine learning methods for Molecular Dynamics of proton transfer in water chains

The aim of this project is to develop machine learning techniques to complement the Molecular Dynamics simulation of proton transfer through chains of water molecules, a phenomenon that occours in different common proteins. The repository currently includes statistical methods for calculation of Force Field parameters from Quantum Mechanics simulated data of a Zundel Ion.
